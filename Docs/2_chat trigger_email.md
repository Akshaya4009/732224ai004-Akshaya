- Add a chat trigger as the first step of the workflow.
- Add the AI Agent node, which will respond to our questions.
- Connect the chat trigger to the AI Agent.
- Inside the AI Agent, there is a chat model option.
- Add the Google Gemini chat model, where we can provide the API key.
- Connect the AI Agent to the Gemini model so the AI Agent can receive messages from Gemini.
- Finally, send a message through the chat trigger; it will be processed by the AI Agent and Gemini.
- This allows us to receive an answer to our question.
